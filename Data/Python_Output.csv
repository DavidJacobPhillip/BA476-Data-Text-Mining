670772142,4,2019-4,Australia,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,Disneyland_HongKong,ever disneyland anywhere find disneyland hong kong similar layout walk main street familiar feel one ride small world absolutely fabulous worth day visit fairly hot relatively busy queue move fairly well

670623270,4,2019-4,United Arab Emirates,"Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it.",Disneyland_HongKong,thanks god hot humid I visit park otherwise would big issue not lot shade I arrive around 1030am leave 6 pm unfortunately I last evening parade 8 5 hour much I plenty everyone find something interesting enjoy extremely busy long time I queue certain attraction 45 minute really not bad although I amazing time I feel bit underwhelmed choice ride attraction park quite small I really expect something grand even main castle close way quite small food option good coffee shop include starbuck plenty gift shop no issue toilet everywhere together great day I really enjoy
670607911,4,2019-4,Australia,"HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it.",Disneyland_HongKong,hk disneyland great compact park unfortunately quite bit maintenance work go present number area close include famous castle go midweek not crowded certainly no near bus la disneyland notice visit price food drink etc really go roof prepared pay top dollar snack avoid souvenir shop regardless kid love
